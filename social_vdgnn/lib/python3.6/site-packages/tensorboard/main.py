"""TensorBoard main module.

This module ties together `tensorboard.program` and
`tensorboard.default_plugins` to provide standard TensorBoard. It's
meant to be tiny and act as little other than a config file. Those
wishing to customize the set of plugins or static assets that
TensorBoard uses can swap out this file with their own.
