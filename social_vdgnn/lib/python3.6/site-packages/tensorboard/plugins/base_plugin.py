          handle this function returns must be closed. It is assumed that you
          will pass this file handle to zipfile.ZipFile. This zip file should
          also have been created by the tensorboard_zip_file build rule.

        be `None` if `flags.generic_data` is set to `"false"`.
      db_connection_provider: Function taking no arguments that returns a
          PEP-249 database Connection object, or None if multiplexer should be
          used instead. The returned value must be closed, and is safe to use in
          a `with` statement. It is also safe to assume that calling this

          single thread. Things like connection pooling are considered

          is set, the db_uri should be None.
      multiplexer: An EventMultiplexer with underlying TB data. Plugins should
          copy this data over to the database when the db fields are set.
      plugin_name_to_instance: A mapping between plugin name to instance.
          Plugins may use this property to access other plugins. The context
          object is passed to plugins during their construction, so a given
          plugin may be absent from this mapping until it is registered. Plugin
